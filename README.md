Install Magenta/MIDI interfaces:


#### Automated Install of Magenta

If you are running Mac OS X or Ubuntu, you can try using our automated
installation script. Just paste the following command into your terminal.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/magenta/master/magenta/tools/magenta-install.sh > /tmp/magenta-install.sh
bash /tmp/magenta-install.sh
```

### Install RtMidi

The interface uses a python library called [mido](http://mido.readthedocs.io) to
interface your computer's MIDI hub. For it to work, you need to separately
install a backend library it can use to connect to your system. Below are
instructions for installing RtMidi. Note that if you used our
[installer script](/README.md#automated-install), RtMidi will already be
installed.

**Mac:**

```bash
pip install --pre python-rtmidi
```

### Connect/Install MIDI Controller

If you are using a hardware controller, attach it to the machine. If you do not
have one, you can install a software controller such as
[VMPK](http://vmpk.sourceforge.net/) by doing the following.

**Ubuntu:** Use the command `sudo apt-get install vmpk`.<br />
**Mac:** Download and install from the
[VMPK website](http://vmpk.sourceforge.net/#Download).

If using FluidSynth, you will also want to install a decent soundfont. You can
install one by doing the following:

**Ubuntu:** Use the command `sudo apt-get install fluid-soundfont-gm`.<br />
**Mac:** Download the soundfont from
http://www.musescore.org/download/fluid-soundfont.tar.gz and unpack the SF2
file.
